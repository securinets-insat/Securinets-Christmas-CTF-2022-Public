## Description

Pets, pets, pets yes these fluffy creatures are the only thing beside my coffee that I want next to me when working. That's why I made this cool website where everyone can share their pet pictures to my server. Let me tell you a secret, I fell asleep while coding my upload functionality, but when I woke up it looked finished to me well and secure.

Let's see if you can prove me wrong :)
